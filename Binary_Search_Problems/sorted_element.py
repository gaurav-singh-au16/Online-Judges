Sorted Elements
Give a list of numbers nums, return the number of elements that are in the correct indices, if the list were to be sorted.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums
Example 1
Input
nums = [1, 7, 3, 4, 10]
Output
2
Explanation
Comparing nums and its sorted version we find that elements 1 and 10 are in their correct positions.
