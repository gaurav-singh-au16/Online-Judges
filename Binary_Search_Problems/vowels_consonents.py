Given a lowercase alphabet string s, return a string with all the vowels of s in sorted order followed by all the consonants of s in sorted order.

Note: vowels are ["a", "e", "i", "o", "u"] and consonants are all other characters.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of s
Example 1
Input
s = "decalin"
Output
"aeicdln"
Explanation
Vowels are "eai" which when sorted is "aei"
