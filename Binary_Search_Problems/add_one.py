Question 235 of 991
You are given a list of integers nums, representing a decimal number and nums[i] is between [0, 9].

For example, [1, 3, 9] represents the number 139.

Return the same list in the same representation except modified so that 1 is added to the number.

Constraints

n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums.
Example 1
Input
nums = [1, 9, 1]
Output
[1, 9, 2]
Example 2
Input
nums = [9]
Output
[1, 0]
